# Self-energy

Code and data for the computation of the self-energy EPRL spinfoam amplitude.

So far we uploaded only the codes for the computations on multiple nodes across a cluster. 

**The remaining codes, data and notebooks will be uploaded soon, along with a short guide to illustrate their structure.**
